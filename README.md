# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Ultimately, my goal is to transform the data that has been made available to me into a dataset that can be relied on for delivering hard results and solid insights. What this means is it needs to be cleaned up; duplicates removed, useless info purged, and inconsistencies made consistent.

## Process
Using a combination of LHL-provided and online reference materials for assistance, I devised my own process for cleaning and parsing data. This process is as follows:<br>

**1. Remove irrelevant data (from the source)**, such as empty columns.<br>
**2. Remove or filter duplicate data**, such as copied rows.<br>
**3. Remedy data inconsistencies**, such as matching data values or types that have been entered inconsistently.<br>
**4. Regulate data**, such as setting monetary values to one standard, dates to one format, etc.<br>
**5. Resolve issues with data gaps**, whether that means filling in what NULL values I can with the data available or else filtering related results out, depending on what is needed of the data.<br>
> Note: In a work setting, I could also attempt to resolve data gap problems by seeking out the missing data (i.e. collecting more data to fill in any gaps present).


## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
